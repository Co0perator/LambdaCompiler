Section 1: Language Rules

1. Every function and variable of any kind shall be reffered to as a Box.
2. Boxes will contain a pointer to whatever data or function they represent
. unchanging variables and functions, known as "constants" shall be made using the DEFINE token

Section 2: Language Tokens
	this section gives all LambdaLang tokens and how they will be written inside of a LambdaLang source code file.
	More information on these tokens can be found in Section 1: Language Rules
	The format of this section is: [token] "[how it is written]" ([notes])

NAME "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_" (the how it is written section of this token simply contains the characters that may be used inside of this token)

PARAM "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_" (the how it is written section of this token simply contains the characters that may be used inside of this token)

LAMBDA "^" (this token is used to denote a parameter, and the use of one immediatley after an instance of the DEFINE or ASSIGN tokens denotes the beginning of a function)

DEFINE ":=" (this denotes the making of an unchanging function or variable)

ASSIGN "=" (this denotes either the making or the changing of an already made function or variable)

REFERENCE "&" (this acts similarly to a function returning a pointer to the function or variable given by a NAME token immediatley following this token)

DEREFERENCE "*" (this acts similarly to a function returning the value pointed to by the pointer passed into it by the NAME token immediatley following it, and it can be used to call functions given a pointer to them)

SEPARATOR "." (this token separates parameters from each other and the body of a function)

APPLICATOR " " (this token is used to call functions and pass in arguments to them)
